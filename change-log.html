Answers for Mark:
<br> for the map views: <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/usage#standard-usage-limits"> Free until exceeding 25,000 map loads per 24 hours for 90 consecutive days</a>
<br> fixed the message-box in "contact us". It's no longer scrollable. 
<br> the search engine is going to be google. I leave a free version of it in the "home-page" search section for demonstration.
<br> By the post box I meant the section you wanted at the bottom of "about us". The one that is supposed to be updated with the news of the company. Will do it together with the login part.
<br>Updated the map, it is still quite off the mark, will be waiting for more accurate location.
<br>By the title bar, I mean the one that includes the name of the page. At the very top of the page, where the close botton of the tab is located in your browser. currently it is a minified version of your logo, which in my humble opinion is not good enough .
<br>For the youtube address I did a bit of searching but came up with nothing. will be waiting for your update.
<br>The mobile version of the menu will be pulled to the right from now on.
<br>Ariel font-family for everything except headings and menu links.

<br>Search and Login now have labels in mobile view.
<br>Optimized font-size in small screens.
<br>info@solarnrj.my is now a link that redirects users to their email providers for easier access.
<br>Optimizes Go to Top button for smaller screens. It no longer goes out of the screen and always stays away from the right edge of the screen on every size.
